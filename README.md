## How to Use

Simply clone or download the repository and open the `egg_bhurji_recipe.html` file in your web browser. No build process or dependencies are required.

## SEO & Structured Data

This project places a strong emphasis on search engine optimization. It includes:
* **Meta Tags:** A descriptive title, meta description, and relevant keywords to improve search visibility.
* **JSON-LD for Recipes:** A `<script type="application/ld+json">` block contains structured data that describes the content as a recipe to search engines. This enables rich results, showing details like cooking time, ratings, and ingredients directly on the search results page.

## Project Philosophy

The goal was to move beyond a static, text-based recipe and create a tool that is genuinely useful and engaging for the home cook. The design prioritizes a task-oriented flow that mirrors the real-world process of cooking: gathering ingredients, following steps, and then personalizing the dish. By making the recipe interactive, it becomes less of a document to read and more of a companion in the kitchen.
